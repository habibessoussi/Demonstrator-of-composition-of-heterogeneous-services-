Demonstrator of composition of heteregenous services with SCA
=============================================================

ABSTRACT
--------
Relatively a new technology, SCA architecture through its 
implementation Apache Tuscany will be thoroughly tested by 
a wide-range of demos which will explore the limits of its 
faculties to connect heterogeneous (in implementation and 
communication protocols) components.  This project aims then to 
discover first this technology, second to test it through simple
examples and finally to develop an application, in this case a 
Chat Application, responding to SCA requirements. 

##REPOSITORY
