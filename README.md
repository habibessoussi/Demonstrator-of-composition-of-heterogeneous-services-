Demonstrator of composition of heteregenous services with SCA
=============================================================

##ABSTRACT

Relatively a new technology, SCA architecture through its 
implementation Apache Tuscany will be thoroughly tested by 
a wide-range of demos which will explore the limits of its 
faculties to connect heterogeneous (in implementation and 
communication protocols) components.  This project aims then to 
discover first this technology, second to test it through simple
examples and finally to develop an application, in this case a 
Chat Application, responding to SCA requirements. 

##REPOSITORY

1) **ChatSCA_V3.1**: The project folder of the last stable version
                 of ChatSCA application
                 
2) **rapport.pdf**:  The project's report which is written in frensh
                 language and in which we describe the application,
                 its architecture and implementation
          
3) **annexe.pdf**:   The report's appendix which describes the met 
                 limits of SCA and Apache Tuscany, also written
                 in frensh language.
